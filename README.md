# [Biobank XR Experience](https://github.com/niccybuzz/Biobank-XR-Experience)

Biobank XR Experience is a mixed reality laboratory simulation for the Meta Quest 3.

This project is my individual project submission for the MSc Software Development course at Queen's University Belfast.
It was developed using Unity with the Meta All-In-One SDK for building MR applications.

## Project Abstract

The Northern Ireland Biobank provides the infrastructure necessary for the collection, storage, and management of biological samples along with associated health and medical data for use primarily for cancer studies. 

Although sample donation to the NIB is voluntary and participation rates are high, the ongoing demand for high-quality biological materials in medical research underscores the need for effective public communication and education. 

This project developed a Mixed Reality simulation of a biobank laboratory, allowing users without a scientific background to experience various laboratory processes in a safe and entertaining way with the aim of promoting public engagement and increasing volunteer sign up rates.

The simulation was created using Unity game development software and is specifically designed for the Meta Quest 3 Mixed Reality Headset. The project includes two primary activities selectable from a main menu, supplemented by tutorials for setup and engagement, a custom soundtrack, and a “challenge mode” that gamifies the experience by imposing a time limit and scoring system.

## Getting Started

To install the app into your Quest 3, download or clone the repository into your Unity projects directory.
Unzip the contents and open the project file up in Unity.

Build the project in Unity then install the .apk file to the Quest through Sidequest or Meta Quest Developer Hub.

Before using the app, you will need to configure your scene model to have a table anchor at least 1 x 0.3m, a single storage anchor, and optionally some wall art.

## Contribution

Contribution to the project is not permitted, due to it being an individual project submission for a Master's thesis.
If you would like to modify the app, please make a fork.
