Thank you for purchasing the "Science Lab - Test Tubes Rack and Well" pack from KittandaDesign

This is a simple asset pack that contains 7 prefabs from 3 meshes created by me. 

I have set up the prefabs in the Prefab folder for you to drag and drop into your scenes. 

There is a high res reflection probe set up in the example scene that might slow things down, so just disable it. I used it for the higher res promo video. 

Model
-----
The 3 models are held in a collection model named TestTubeSet. Simply drag it into your scene and unpack the object to access the individual pieces if you
do not want to use the prefabs. 

UVs are unwrapped.

Pivot for the Test Tube is close to the top of the tube to emulate where it might be held

Pivot for the well and rack are centered and placed at their lowest point

Textures
--------

7 Texture sets were made using a PBR workflow. 
I have set up the materials for the prefabs using a Standard Specular setup using the maps:
Albedo, AO, Emission, Normal, Specular
There are also the maps for: Basecolor, Metallic, Roughness, if you want to set up differently

Scripts
-------

I wrote a Controller Script for the experience called "ExampleSceneController" and is used to run the example scene. All it does is rotate the center display area if there is a object to display and houses a number of Arrays that you can populate with things you want to display. Feel free to use this code and the objects I have added to the scene for your own work if you choose. 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me as I am always happy to create more materials for my 
models or work on commissions!

Hope you have a great day further!
Gerrit
